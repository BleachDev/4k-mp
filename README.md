### Notes

To make your game publicly accessible from the Java version you **need** to forward port 25575 to your computer in your router settings.  
The Java and web version are **not** cross-compatible due to the way P2P browser connection works.

##### Disclaimer: I am not qualified to write networking code, you probably shouldn't let random people connect to your computer.
